# PythonMap 

A Python project that shows users the locations of volcanoes on the map.

Markers are displayed based on height. Green markers are smaller volcanoes(less than 1000m). and red markers are larger(larger than 3000m) and orange is in between. 

Folium library was used to make this project as well as pandas for the data.

Data of volcanoes was taken from a text file.

Countries are also coloured based on population size. Countries with large populations are in red and the ones with the least are in green. Orange is in between.

Simply clone the repository and run the Map1.html file to run the application.
